# üß© Sudoku Solver in Python

Academic project from an **Introduction to Computer Science** course.  
The program implements a **Sudoku solver**, including board validation, automatic solving steps, and user interaction when multiple options are available.

---

## üìö Features

- **Board Validation**: checks if a Sudoku board is legal (no duplicates in rows, columns, or 3x3 boxes).
- **Options Calculation**: for each empty cell, calculates all possible digits that can be placed there.
- **Automatic Solving**: fills cells with a single possible digit.
- **User Interaction**: if multiple digits are possible, the program asks the user to choose.
- **Random Board Generation**: creates a Sudoku board with 10‚Äì20 random numbers placed legally.
- **Board Printing**: displays the board in a clear format on the console or writes it into a text file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

- The board is represented as a 9√ó9 list of lists.  
  - Filled cells contain digits `1‚Äì9`.  
  - Empty cells are represented by `-1`.  
- Constants are defined for solver states:  
  - `FINISH_SUCCESS` ‚Äì board solved successfully.  
  - `FINISH_FAILURE` ‚Äì board not solvable or contains contradictions.  
  - `NOT_FINISH` ‚Äì board not yet complete.  
- The solver works in stages:  
  1. Fills cells with only one possible option.  
  2. If needed, asks the user to select a digit for the cell with the fewest options.  
  3. Repeats until success or failure.

## üìñ Example Boards

The project demonstrates solving of:
- A fully valid board
- A partially filled board
- An impossible board
- An invalid board (with duplicates)
- A rendomaly geenerated board

## üíª Example Outputs

1. The board is not finished yet  
In the location: (0, 2) The current possibilities are: [1, 2, 4, 8]  
Please choose one number:  

2. "FINISH_SUCCESS" (Board solved successfully!)
